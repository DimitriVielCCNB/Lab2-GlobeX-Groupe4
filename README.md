# Lab2-GlobeX
GlobeX wants a nice website and is going to us to design it


The Globex Corporation headquarters is located in Cypress Creek, a company town built to house the company's employees. The "innocent" part of Globex Corporation shows that the work in Globex is very casual. The headquarters contains a fitness room, and employees are allowed to dress in casual wear. According to Hank, Globex Corporation does not believe in walls (only windows, as evident in the headquarters). There are also lots of greenery inside the headquarters. The darker side of Globex Corporation is revealed in the form of a large "doomsday device" located in a large chamber under a mountain, which Hank attempted to use to take over the East Coast, which he does. A reference was made to a Weather Control and Bacteriological Warfare division within the Globex Corporation.
